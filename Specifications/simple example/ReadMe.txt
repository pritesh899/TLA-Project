To understand how the Pluscal algorithm and TLC model checker works: In this example we took the instances of x to be 1 to 1000 and in the next step we multiplied each instance of x with 2 and formed a new state. The program in between the comments (*......*) is the PlusCal algorithm and Êprogram between the BEGIN TRANSLATION and END TRANSLATION is the translated TLA+ program.
When we run this model, TLC will check all the possible states, any failures if any, invariants and possible deadlocks. This program would work perfectly as we donÕt have any invariants in it. But when we put the invariants like e.g : "x should never be equal to 1001" and run TLC model checker it will give an error where the initial state and next state at which error occurred. In our case initial state was x = 1000 and next step was x=1001 where the error occurred. This example helped us to learn the working of the TLA+ toolbox and using it to verify our systems.
