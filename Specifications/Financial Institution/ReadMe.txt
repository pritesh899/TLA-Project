Question : sketch a design for the following situation and justify your design decisions: A group of nancial institutions want to share information about Cyber attacks (attempted and successful) on their systems but each do not want the other institutions to know which one was actually attacked. The shared consortium needs to verify that that the report comes from a legitimate institution but cannot read the report itself. When the other institutions receive that report, they need to be able to verify that it came one of the other institutions but not know which one. They also need to be able to respond in the same way as the original report. Before joining consortium, an institution must be veried.
