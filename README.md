TLA+ specifications 

TLA+ is a language which was designed for the specification of systems. Unlike other languages, it includes no programming constructs and favors a very simple syntax built around the mathematical theory. Its value lies in its capability to verify systems. In order to understand TLA+ and its merits, we set out to create a few specifications which demonstrate its versatility and power. The two systems which were specified were a distributed system logical clock and a distributed system which can check credentials and securely share information on cyber attacks for financial institutions. In creating these specifications, it became incredibly apparent that the true challenge of TLA+ is the abstraction which is required. The specifications created are described in detail to explain the process and design choices.
